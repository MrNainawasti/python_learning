# Sending email in Python
You can send email in Python by using several libraries, but the most common ones are smtplib and email.

The "smtplib" module in Python defines an SMTP client session object that can be used to send mail to any Internet machine with an SMTP or ESMTP listener daemon.

# SMTP
An application that handles and delivers e-mail over the Internet is called a "mail server". Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a protocol, which handles sending an e-mail and routing e-mail between mail servers. It is an Internet standard for email transmission.
